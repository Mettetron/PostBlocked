# PostBlocked

> PostBlocked is an interactive shiny app that shows the status of international mail in the time of COVID.

> All data used in in PostBlocked is collected by the nice people of [Postcrossing](https://postcrossing.com) and can be accessed directly on their site [here](https://www.postcrossing.com/postal-monitor).

> This repo also contains several helping scripts that were used to perpare data for the app, but are not needed for it to run
